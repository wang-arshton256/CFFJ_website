                            Protecting the family is rightly on top of the agenda for many societies
                            because families make the nation. Amidst the fast-changing global
                            world, families face a number of challenges. In Uganda families face
                            loss of family values, poverty and poor health, _ unethical conduct,
                            crimes, malnutrition, poor mental health and often, death. We recognize
                            that family in Uganda has some unique characteristics including the
                            extended family systems and polygamy and some with no clear bread
                            winners and many dependents. On the basis of a wide range of reviews of
                            the evidence and biblical teaching we identify the following areas for
                            possible policy interventions:

                                    farming methods would climate-proof their harvests, minimizing
                                    crop losses, while increasing crop yields. In addition,
                                    agricultural entrepreneurship should be promoted to facilitate
                                    the financial empowerment of individuals.

                                    should grant local governments more autonomy over fundraising
                                    and development within the national development framework.
                                    Autonomy also increases once the districts are more vigilant in
                                    raising more local revenues and donor funds. A self-financing
                                    model for local government financing would reduce the central
                                    government's funding burden while boosting local development.
